# sevenwonders

These are some tools to facilitate playing the board game seven wonders with packs: Edifice, Armada, Leaders, Cities.

## Tool 1: War Results. 

Choose one player involved in war, and input the rest of the players involved in war in a clockwise or counter-clockwise order. The Win or Lose for each player will be displayed. 

Players could be out of the fight due to peaceful dove. Simply do not include them in the "players involved."

This does not include the additional fight in Armada. That must be calculated on its own.

## Tool 2: Coin Score.

Input the amount of cash. Input the amount of debt (positive integer). Automatically divide the cash by three and minus the debt.

## Tool 3: Science Score.

Due to black cards that steal from your neighbors, some times you have to choose between two symbols. Due to wild cards or wonder or leader, sometimes you can choose from all three symbols. How do you maximize the science score? 

Input the number of each symbol (or a card that represents choosing from 2 or 3 symbols) you have for science. The tool automatically calculate all possible combinations and arrange them for top to bottom.

## Tool 4: Total Score.

Input the number of players. Input the scores in each category. Automatically calculate their total scores, and arrange them in a descending order.

If there are 4 or 6 players, let the first 2 or 3 players be from the same team. Automatically calculate team scores.
